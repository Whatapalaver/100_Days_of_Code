# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Angela Wolff]

This is the log of my second #100DaysOfCode challenge. 
I've decided to set-up round 2 to coincide with the start of Makers Academy pre-course 11th June 2018. 

## Log

### R2D1
I'm still waiting for the pre-course details to be delivered to my inbox, so in eager anticipation, I turn back to Codewars and dabble until I rank upto 5kyu. I am slipping back to SQL kata as I find these so much easier than Ruby. I won't let Ruby slip too far, in fact it will get all my focus over the next few weeks but I do enjoy testing my SQL skills from work.

The pre-course email is in and I am now wading through introductory courses on command line and the terminal. I've never found this terribly exciting which will be why I still struggle to navigate my way around. Not for much longer though.
