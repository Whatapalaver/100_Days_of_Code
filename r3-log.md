## Log

### R3D76/77
The past two days have been given over to GraphQL. I built a GraphQL server in Rails yesterday and today I’m working on the Frontend implementation of a pre-prepared Node server. I’m pretty impressed with the concepts but it might take me a while to fully geasp modifiers and resolvers. 

### R3D75
More RoR and React experimentation.

### R3D74 January 2nd 2019
Started the New Year preparing for my new job. So that means fathoming out how to link Ruby on Rails with React.

### R3D73 Monday xmas Eve
More swift programming challenges today.

### R3D72 Friday 21 Dec
After celebrating yesterday's job offers I finally felt able to relaxe a bit today but I have still been making progress with the [Swift course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/100CAEAkMdcF1QQ3g=/). It's a pretty good course with plenty of opportunity to put yourself to the test. My aim is to have created a simple food logging app by the end so that I can stop paying a monthly subscription for my current photo logging app.

### R3D69 - R3D71
I haven't been keeping up to date with the logging but I have been coding every day. The first day I was refactoring one of my tech tests and then defending myself at the tech interview.
Then I started a new ios app development course using Swift. I'm totally covering my bases in case I need to go to the next careers fair.
Finally I had an interview at a very exciting organisation and joy of joys I was offered the role the next day. Whoop whoop.

### R3D68
I am back on Frontend Masters today and kicking off with the Four Semesters of Computer Science in 5 hours workshop. That's taking me back to Big O notation and brings me closer to actually finishing my sock sorting blog. Watch this space...
Frontend Masters are pretty top notch - the thing that sets them apart is their focus on sreen real estate. They consistently zoom and resize so the code occupies the full screen. This stuff matters when you need specs or like to view on your iPhone.

### R3D67
Today's tech test was a seemingly simple Ruby / Sinatra routing challenge. It involved multipath and dynamic routing and did manage to tie me in knots a bit. I found myself staring off into to space while I virtually coded my way into numerous deadends. In the end it proved quite successful to just sit down and bash out code until I found a route out of the mayhem. It proved to be a pretty interesting challenge and I'm grateful for the diversity of tech challenges I'm facing while trying to secure my first developer role.

### R3D66
Back to back rejections today. I'm getting interesting feedback along the lines of 'great tech skills', 'super interesting background' 'but.....'. The 'but.....' is obviously the kicker and is rarely very actionable. I have to just keep sucking it up and continue coding. I feel farely satisfied that by the time someone actually gives me a job I will be a pretty kick ass coder. Having said that, today's #AdventOfCode took me an absolute age to complete. These challenges are tres tricky!

### R3D65
Tech interview day today. The pairing challenge was to create a browser based countdown timer in javascript. I was a bit panicked initially as I somehow see to have skipped over basic DOM manipulation in vanilla javascript and have jumped straight to react whenever I have client side work. Anyway, it went well enough. I was allowed to use google and we worked our way through setInterval() and clearInterval() and had a functioning ticker in no time.

### R3D64
Two interviews today and a new tech test to puzzle over. This one appears to be a simple Ruby and Sinatra routing challenge but I've spent quite some time puzzling out how it might work.

### R3D63 Mon 10th Dec
With the tech tests out of the way I am back to the Advent of Code but I am still stuck on Day 4. These little challenges are proving to be fairly tricky. They involve a load of file import and data cleansing work that I am unfamiliar with but that at least makes them fairly realistic tests. This challenge involves working out which guards sleep the most and I'm feeling the sting of layered complexity as I didn't use a TDD approach and just opted to code freehand. It's a bit disheartening that these challenges take me so long to complete!

### R3D62 Sat 8th Dec
I am now away on a code free weekend break but I had a slight brainwave while watching Udemy videos in the bath. I've quickly opened the laptop and put the finishing touches to my C# tech test and it is good to submit now.

### R3D61
Today I am panic coding in C# - desperately trying to fathom out constructor functions so I can get these snakes and ladders in action before lunchtime. I'm hoping to escape for the weekend to visit family and this tech test needs to be submitted by Sunday.

### R3D60
I converted yesterdays anagram solution into a React frontend. It was remarkably quick and easy to fashion - I have to admit that React is becoming a joy! I cheated a bit by stealing much of the css grid layout that I had prepared for my SuperHero side project but then React is all about reusable components!

This afternoon is for C# focus. I am cramming Udemy videos so that I have a chance of being able to convert my snakes and ladders program. So far I am pretty hopeful. I like C# its like Java and is also making me reminisce about VBA.

### R3D59
I re-read the tech test instructions and realised that my plan to create my anagram solver in Ruby was not going to impress much as they specified a desire to be wowed by my Javascript prowess. That is a shame and caused quite a problematic afternoon as I'm just not used to doing my OOP apps in anything other than Ruby. Still, it was nailed before mignight which is a win. The Advent of Code solutions I'd done over the last couple of days proved to be really useful as they'd forced me to deal with text files. I hope to catch up with the lost days once my tech tests are complete.

### R3D58 Tue Dec 4th
Hard to believe but today is the first time I've attempted a CLI. I've always used IRB and thought that was the equivalent but I received some tech test feedback criticising my reliance on IRB and its made me reconsider what CLI means. I wish it hadn't as I'm now facing a whole new challenge of how to test a program that is currently running. My Rspec is just hanging....

### R3D56
Advent of Code is supposed to be a fun little treat but it is consuming my entire day! Regex seems to rule the waves. I hate Regex!

### R3D55 Dec 1st
I started the Advent of Code challenge with the Zero to Mastery group. It was simple yet remarkably challenging so I will do well to dillegently work my way through the next 25 days. I need as much exposure to varied javascript problems as I can. 

Finished off applying my css grid composition onto my Superhero React project. 

### R3D54
I set up my Superhero React app and ensured I could both link it to an Express backend and host on Heroku before I progressed too far. I inevitably had hosting issues and some very strange behaviour with my Heroku app which seemed to be down to caching issues. When I fathomed out how to purge the cache, the design bounced back to the expected. 

### R3D53 Thurs 27 Nov
Today I worked through Day 1 of the Design for Designers course by Sarah Drassner of Frontend Masters. It's very good and I'm rather pleased with my experimentation with css grid, inspired by Swiss design. I've got it in mind for my Super Hero side project despite not really knowing what that will do...

### R3D52
Back to react. I am now running through Dave Ceddia's Pure React book. It's pretty good so far and encourages quite a bit of experimentation as you run through the exercises to build more components.

### R3D51 Mon 26 Nov
Interview day today so I reviewed my tech test and annoyingly found some errors where dependencies weren't specified in my gemfile. Too flippin late now. The tech interview also revealed another error in the placement of my call to simplecov that ensured I always got 100% coverage. Might have been a great wheeze if it hadn't been discovered.

### R3D50 Sat 24 Nov
I'm moving on the the Intermediate React workshop today with Brian Holt. It was a toss up between this and Javascript fundamentals but the React course deals with production ready code which I've already identified as a stumbling block.

### R3D49
I finished the Intro to React course and now have a pretty nifty app that links to an american pet adoption api. I am currently struggling to get this hosted which is perhaps a result of it not being created with create-react-app. Every tutorial I can find for hosting instructions seems to be based around CRA. I need to get the build and hosting process clear in my head as this is always a stumbling block for me. We learned how to use React Context which has similar functionality to Redux and it wasn't all that terrifying.

### R3D48
I started the Complete Intro to React V4 workshop today with Brian Holt on FEM. I've learned so many tips from the first few sessions on things like linting and generally setting up the whole app. We aren't using create-react-app at this stage as it hides much of the nitty gritty wiring.

### R3D47
Finished the flexbox and grid workshop on FEM today and played around creating some Mondrian art in css.

### R3D45 Monday 19 Nov
I started a subscription with Frontend Masters (FEM) today as I'm aware that my frontend and particularly my styling skills are potentially letting me down. I spent the day using flexbox and getting my head around media queries. Jen Kramer @jen4web is a pretty good tutor. 

### R3D44
It was the global day of coderetreat today and I spent it at Makers with Ladies of Code working through iterations of Conway’s Game of Life with assorted pair partners. working in both javascript and ruby. 

### R3D43
I managed to resolve both my rackup and Heroku issues this morning so my app is hosted. I'm going to update my simple Ruby app boilerplate project so that I don't run into this issue again...

### R3D42
Back to my card shuffling app. I spent the morning working in the coffee shop trying to debug rackup issues. I had multiple ways of launching my server but they weren't all functioning in the same way. I was left wondering if part of my problem was because I was using my iPhone hotspot rather than home wifi. I trekked back home to find that the problem was real! Loads more time spent debugging and trying to host on Heroku. Also some joy was to be found in additional features and the ability to get the game working via an html GUI.

### R3D41
Spent the morning interviewing with Songkick. Really enjoyed both their tech test challenge which was the web scraper and then this mornings pairing session which involved implementing new features and refactoring code as new integration tests were added.

### R3D40
Loads of work on the tech test - a simple card dealing game. 

### R3D39 Monday 12 Nov
Kicked off another tech test today.

### R3D38
Tech test successfully submitted with pagination success. Now its back to the Angular tutorial. It's getting pretty hairy now and I'm wondering how long it would take me to be able to do a non-tutorial guided project. Answer would no doubt be a very long time. I'm also having many styling issues. Have I mentioned how much I hate css?

### R3D37
I'm still prepping for my "2 hour" tech test due tomorrow. So far I've struggled my way through rspec mocking of nokogiri web scrapes and now I'm trying to fathom out how to loop (and scrape) through multiple web pages when the results are paginated.

### R3D36
I have a tech test to do tomorrow which involves a webscraping challenge to be completed in 2 hours! Personally I think a 2 hour time limit for a brand new task is a bit unrealistic but as they've released the details of the challenge early I expect they intend us to complete some research before we start. Today I have been setting myself up some boilerplate templates as I don't want to waste any time setting up a bog standard ruby project with rspec loaded and ready to go. This afternoon I hope to attempt a webscrape using both nokogiri with ruby and cheerio for nodejs, so I can decide which language I would prefer to run with.

I spent the evening at a Javascript London meetup listening to a very engaging talk on the Javascript concurrency model. 

### R3D35 Monday 5th Nov
Today I built my first Angular web app with the aid of #ngGirls who were running a full day workshop at the AngularConnect conference at eXcel London. 

### R3D34
Mocking and testing with Jest.

### R3D33
I spent the morning living the dream.....coding from the coffee shop. It perhaps wasn't the most dreamlike coffee shop (it was in Norbury afterall), but it was still conducive to a good few hours toiling with APIs. They get pretty repetitive after a while.

### R3D32
Refreshing my knowledge of mongoDB and setting up async functions with fairly complex find queries. I knew yesterday's lesson on promises would come in handy.

### R3D31
Back to real JS basics today with `return new Promise((resolve, reject) {});`

### R3D30
Well rather unforgivably I let myself down at yesterday's pair programming session. While I accept that I was never going to be much use with the totally alien Redux challenge, I ought to have been very much more capable with the API testing. So, I am back to square one and am refocussing my efforts on all things Node.js and React. Although I still cannot help but broaden my horizons a little so am tempted to dabble with GraphQL and mix things up with React Native. Machine Learning experiments will also continue on the side....

I've ploughed on today with a very good Nodejs Udemy course by Mosh Hamedani and kicked off my side project called "Calling All Superheroes".

### R3D29 Monday 29_Oct
Mega interview day with pair-programming.

### R328
More codewars

### R3D27
More codewars but I've also started a course on Machine Learning with Stephen Grider. I finally understand why I had to learn about vector and matrix multiplication back at school, many, many years ago.

### R3D26
Tech interview day was successful so now I need to prepare for pair programming sessions. I've opted to do this by completing codewars kata as they prepare me well for actually writing javascript code.

### R3D25
Following the submission of my tech test I now have a technical interview scheduled for tomorrow. Today was consumed with refreshing javascript basics like hoisting. Basically I just googled javascript technical interview questions and absorbed.

### R3D24
Testing React is made extra tricky when you didn't use the create-react-app technique. I've wasted the morning trying to fathom out how to get Jest to work. The afternoon was consumed with some rather perfunctory tests. I gave up with the components that involved a fetch. That's another challenge to add to my to do list.

### R3D23 Monday 22_Oct
Well I had a lot of fun today with heroku again. Having decided not to use create-react-app for my react frontend build I was then left feeling a bit unsupported when I couldn't get Heroku to host any of my frontend. Hours of researching parcel documentation (replacement for webpacker) and eventually I fathomed out that the build was stored in dist and not build.... Anyway, I do now have both the frontend and backend API on Heroku. It's spread across odd branches as Github has been misbehaving for hours today. I just need to fathom out tests, do something semi-fancy with my loading tables and then I should be good to go with this tech test.

Tonight I have a meetup where we will build a neural network from scratch.

### R3D22
I spent the day trying to catch up with the coursework from the Machine Learning course I started at the beginning of the week. I'm boiling my head with high speed visualisations of minimising the square of diffeneces. Everything is learned at 1.5x playback speed since Makers.

### R3D21 Saturday 18_Oct
Made loads of progress today. Sussed out how to pass props down to my table component by including it in the parents render function rather than in app.js. Sorted out how to map through my api call to display in the table rows. I've nearly finished the tech test although I still haven't fathomed out what I need redux for and I haven't written any tests. My api calls are painfully slow as well so I must have missed a better approach as its currently intolerable from a user perspective.

### R3D17
This dragonstack course is pretty challenging and I haven't even got to React yet, I need to crack on or else it will be more of a hindrance to my tech test progress. I've been spending a little time on the tech test today, mostly setting up the structure of the backend and pondering how my api should look in order to allow the React app to select specific fields. Do I need multiple api's for each potential field (I suspect that's a no) or somehow pass the field name as a param to the get query. This sounds more likely but also yet another thing that I don't know how to do. In order to feel like I'm making some progress I have set up the program to deliver an api that is currently fixed to show the stats for the education field. At least with this progress I can move onto the frontend communication and styling.

### R3D16
I was issued with my first real tech test today which requires me to generate an API from a DB hosted on AWS and generate a single page website in React/Redux to show a summary according to the selected variable selected. I'm juggling this challenge with a Udemy course called Dragonstack as I think it will prove useful in the React implementation. I'm taking the time to really understand each section of the implementation rather than the time pressured pragmatism of, settling for something that works.

### R3D15
Finished my first post-Makers Rails application [Univ App](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/univ_app). I found it really handy to walk through a professional approach to Rails app execution. I learned a few debug tricks using byebug but also felt far more familiar with the DIY user authentication using bcrypt. It's also the first project where I feel pretty happy with the design of the frontend.

### R3D13
More Rails today and then I had fun unpicking the experiment with haml. I don’t like it. It may be neater but erb follows the rules of html which I already understand, with haml it feels like I have to learn too much syntax. I’ve been writing in erb and converting to haml which isn’t great workflow. 

### R3D12
I feel a little blown by the wind at the moment. Everytime I see a new company that I am interested in, I shift my focus to their current stack. It's a bit like the early days of dabbling with coding when I spent most of my time wondering which language I should start with. At least today I have made some good progress with Ruby on Rails and spent more time focussing on the frontend than I typically have done so far on the journey. I have a neat little app set up that I styled using Google's Materialize (anything to avoid Bootstrap!) and also tried out haml instead of erb for templating.

### R3D10
I've been going loopy with Google Scripts and have now had to fathom a way to export a single sheet to PDF without the need to hide the other sheets. That has led me to the Google Sheets API and a rather neat way to convert a Blob to a PDF. I've set up a new Gist for all things [Google Sheet to PDF Export...](https://gist.github.com/Whatapalaver/4db56950daf84cf1dd2c4765a540e17f) 
Also having fun with Ruby.pow(2) - I feel like a superhero.

### R3D8
I'm back to Conway's Game of Life and loving it. It is tying in nicely with my concurrent studying of Sandi Metz's 99 Bottles of Beer as I have somehow managed to create code with ABC size errors. That's Assignment, Branch, Condition size and means I am forcing my method to do too much. I probably need to read a bit more or risk another question on Stack Overflow.

### R3D6
Spent the day working on a google scripts project. I needed to loop through a product list and create a pdf file showing details for each one. I’ve done something similar in excel before but translating to the javascript google apps language was something new. I’m pretty impressed by the potential within google sheets, I may be about to turn my back on excel. 

### R3D5
Had my first developer interview which turned out to be an analyst role without any development. Shame, as it was a great product and I need to believe in my product. 

Progressing well with Java and I have an interesting natural disaster project brewing with the Makers cohort. 

### R3D4
Scouring NASA APIs today for potential project ideas. Also started the 99 Bottles of Beer refactoring project with Sandi Metz. 

### R3D3
I’m still waiting for feedback from my early Java exercism challenges so I have now added the Kotlin track into the mix. 

### R3D1
So it's Saturday, day after graduation day and I actually have free time and a chance to remind myself what it means to have a family. We went for a walk in the sun and pondered futures.

I'm looking for work now, but I'm keen to make sure that first job sets me off in the direction of an exciting and challenging coding future. I've been scouring LinkedIn for potentially interesting roles and everything that excited me required Java skills. So that's decided. My post Makers month of consolidation requires me to bolster my understanding of javascript and to become pretty adept at Java. It's going to be a fun ride towards challenging employment.

So on Day 1, I've installed IntelliJ Idea and completed "Hello,World!" of the exercism.io Java track. Let's see where this new journey takes me.
