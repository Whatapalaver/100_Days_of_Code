Whatapalaver's 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 5
===

It's time to level up my Rails skills so I'm timing round 5 of 100 Days of Code to coincide with the start of a new coaching relationship with Cezar Halmagean which should give me loads of opportunity for focussed and deliberate rails practice.

- [Round 4](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r4-log.md) this covered the first 9 months or so of my first fullstack developer role
- [Round 3](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r3-log.md) documented the 70 days post Makers graduation where I consolidated the bootcamp experience, completed a stack of technical tests and finally secured myself a couple of job offers before accepting a fullstack role at The V&A.
- [Round 2](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r2-log.md) covered the 99 days of my Makers bootcamp experience. From the pre-course to graduation day.
- [Round 1](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r2-log.md) This was my initial foray into 100 Days of Code.

My first Rails coaching challenge involves me working with ActiveRecord and setting up some many-to-many relationships which mirror some of the struggles I have at work.
[This blog](https://www.sitepoint.com/master-many-to-many-associations-with-activerecord/ very neatly demonstrates 3 scenarios HABTM, has_many :through and has_many :through :source and [this blog](http://joshfrankel.me/blog/create-a-many-to-many-activerecord-association-in-ruby-on-rails/) is equally useful.

I'm already beginning to see the limitations of HABTM now that I want to add more fields to my join table and need to think about validations.
