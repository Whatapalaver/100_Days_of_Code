Whatapalaver's 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 4
===

I've been in my first developer role for about a month and it's clear to me that I am going to have to take my journey to "hot shot professional coder" as seriously as I took the bootcamp experience. I can't afford to drift through the experience and instead need a defined developer's development plan to work through. Something like this [fine roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).

So, with that in mind it's time to kick start Round 4 of 100daysofcode to document the progress and keep me accountable.
My previous accountability rounds are till available here:

- [Round 3](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r3-log.md) documented the 70 days post Makers graduation where I consolidated the bootcamp experience, completed a stack of technical tests and finally secured myself a couple of job offers before accepting a fullstack role at The V&A.
- [Round 2](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r2-log.md) covered the 99 days of my Makers bootcamp experience. From the pre-course to graduation day.
- [Round 1](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r2-log.md) This was my initial foray into 100 Days of Code.


R4D1 - The development plan unveiled
---

In my first month at the museum I've worked across a variety of projects. Working on tickets that fix features on the CMS (a Ruby on Rails application), created a mini executable that translates a IIIF manifest into a customisable pdf document, becoming a leading expert on regex (cough), panicked myself with ssh commands and explored elasticsearch in depth.

There is just so much that I don't know and what I do know, I know I don't really know. There is plenty of opportunity for performance anxiety.

Here's my initial attampt at a pathway to Fullstack competence with a heavy nod to the fact that I'm in a museum - hence the IIIF and Elasticsearch focus.
