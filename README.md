I cut [round 2](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r2-log.md) short on Makers Graduation - day 99 (sacrilege?) and restarted round 3 on Saturday after Makers graduation.

I'm now combining my 100DaysofCode journing with Instagram, see [Whatapalaver Codes](https://www.instagram.com/whatapalaver_codes/) for additional visual excitement of a coding nature!

## Log

### R3D1
So it's Saturday, day after graduation day and I actually have free time and a chance to remind myself what it means to have a family. We went for a walk in the sun and pondered futures.
I'm looking for work now, but I'm keen to make sure that first job sets me off in the direction of an exciting and challenging coding future. I've been scouring LinkedIn for potentially interesting roles and everything that excited me required Java skills. So that's decided. My post Makers month of consolidation requires me to bolster my understanding of javascript and to become pretty adept at Java. It's going to be a fun ride towards challenging employment.

So on Day 1, I've installed IntelliJ Idea and completed "Hello,World!" of the exercism.io Java track. Let's see where this new journey takes me.
