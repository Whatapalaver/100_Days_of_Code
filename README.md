## Log

### R3D40
Loads of work on the tech test - a simple card dealing game. 

### R3D39 Monday 12 Nov
Kicked off another tech test today.

### R3D38
Tech test successfully submitted with pagination success. Now its back to the Angular tutorial. It's getting pretty hairy now and I'm wondering how long it would take me to be able to do a non-tutorial guided project. Answer would no doubt be a very long time. I'm also having many styling issues. Have I mentioned how much I hate css?

### R3D37
I'm still prepping for my "2 hour" tech test due tomorrow. So far I've struggled my way through rspec mocking of nokogiri web scrapes and now I'm trying to fathom out how to loop (and scrape) through multiple web pages when the results are paginated.

### R3D36
I have a tech test to do tomorrow which involves a webscraping challenge to be completed in 2 hours! Personally I think a 2 hour time limit for a brand new task is a bit unrealistic but as they've released the details of the challenge early I expect they intend us to complete some research before we start. Today I have been setting myself up some boilerplate templates as I don't want to waste any time setting up a bog standard ruby project with rspec loaded and ready to go. This afternoon I hope to attempt a webscrape using both nokogiri with ruby and cheerio for nodejs, so I can decide which language I would prefer to run with.

I spent the evening at a Javascript London meetup listening to a very engaging talk on the Javascript concurrency model. 

### R3D35 Monday 5th Nov
Today I built my first Angular web app with the aid of #ngGirls who were running a full day workshop at the AngularConnect conference at eXcel London. 

### R3D34
Mocking and testing with Jest.

### R3D33
I spent the morning living the dream.....coding from the coffee shop. It perhaps wasn't the most dreamlike coffee shop (it was in Norbury afterall), but it was still conducive to a good few hours toiling with APIs. They get pretty repetitive after a while.

### R3D32
Refreshing my knowledge of mongoDB and setting up async functions with fairly complex find queries. I knew yesterday's lesson on promises would come in handy.

### R3D31
Back to real JS basics today with `return new Promise((resolve, reject) {});`

### R3D30
Well rather unforgivably I let myself down at yesterday's pair programming session. While I accept that I was never going to be much use with the totally alien Redux challenge, I ought to have been very much more capable with the API testing. So, I am back to square one and am refocussing my efforts on all things Node.js and React. Although I still cannot help but broaden my horizons a little so am tempted to dabble with GraphQL and mix things up with React Native. Machine Learning experiments will also continue on the side....

I've ploughed on today with a very good Nodejs Udemy course by Mosh Hamedani and kicked off my side project called "Calling All Superheroes".

### R3D29 Monday 29_Oct
Mega interview day with pair-programming.

### R328
More codewars

### R3D27
More codewars but I've also started a course on Machine Learning with Stephen Grider. I finally understand why I had to learn about vector and matrix multiplication back at school, many, many years ago.

### R3D26
Tech interview day was successful so now I need to prepare for pair programming sessions. I've opted to do this by completing codewars kata as they prepare me well for actually writing javascript code.

### R3D25
Following the submission of my tech test I now have a technical interview scheduled for tomorrow. Today was consumed with refreshing javascript basics like hoisting. Basically I just googled javascript technical interview questions and absorbed.

### R3D24
Testing React is made extra tricky when you didn't use the create-react-app technique. I've wasted the morning trying to fathom out how to get Jest to work. The afternoon was consumed with some rather perfunctory tests. I gave up with the components that involved a fetch. That's another challenge to add to my to do list.

### R3D23 Monday 22_Oct
Well I had a lot of fun today with heroku again. Having decided not to use create-react-app for my react frontend build I was then left feeling a bit unsupported when I couldn't get Heroku to host any of my frontend. Hours of researching parcel documentation (replacement for webpacker) and eventually I fathomed out that the build was stored in dist and not build.... Any, I do now have both the frontend and backend API on Heroku. It's spread across odd branches as Github has been misbehaving for hours today. I just need to fathom out tests, do something semi-fancy with my loading tables and then I should be good to go with this tech test.

Tonight I have a meetup where we will build a neural network from scratch.

### R3D22
I spent the day trying to catch up with the coursework from the Machine Learning course I started at the beginning of the week. I'm boiling my head with high speed visualisations of minimising the square of diffeneces. Everything is learned at 1.5x playback speed since Makers.

### R3D21 Saturday 18_Oct
Made loads of progress today. Sussed out how to pass props down to my table component by including it in the parents render function rather than in app.js. Sorted out how to map through my api call to display in the table rows. I've nearly finished the tech test although I still haven't fathomed out what I need redux for and I haven't written any tests. My api calls are painfully slow as well so I must have missed a better approach as its currently intolerable from a user perspective.

### R3D17
This dragonstack course is pretty challenging and I haven't even got to React yet, I need to crack on or else it will be more of a hindrance to my tech test progress. I've been spending a little time on the tech test today, mostly setting up the structure of the backend and pondering how my api should look in order to allow the React app to select specific fields. Do I need multiple api's for each potential field (I suspect that's a no) or somehow pass the field name as a param to the get query. This sounds more likely but also yet another thing that I don't know how to do. In order to feel like I'm making some progress I have set up the program to deliver an api that is currently fixed to show the stats for the education field. At least with this progress I can move onto the frontend communication and styling.

### R3D16
I was issued with my first real tech test today which requires me to generate an API from a DB hosted on AWS and generate a single page website in React/Redux to show a summary according to the selected variable selected. I'm juggling this challenge with a Udemy course called Dragonstack as I think it will prove useful in the React implementation. I'm taking the time to really understand each section of the implementation rather than the time pressured pragmatism of, settling for something that works.

### R3D15
Finished my first post-Makers Rails application [Univ App](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/univ_app). I found it really handy to walk through a professional approach to Rails app execution. I learned a few debug tricks using byebug but also felt far more familiar with the DIY user authentication using bcrypt. It's also the first project where I feel pretty happy with the design of the frontend.

### R3D13
More Rails today and then I had fun unpicking the experiment with haml. I don’t like it. It may be neater but erb follows the rules of html which I already understand, with haml it feels like I have to learn too much syntax. I’ve been writing in erb and converting to haml which isn’t great workflow. 

### R3D12
I feel a little blown by the wind at the moment. Everytime I see a new company that I am interested in, I shift my focus to their current stack. It's a bit like the early days of dabbling with coding when I spent most of my time wondering which language I should start with. At least today I have made some good progress with Ruby on Rails and spent more time focussing on the frontend than I typically have done so far on the journey. I have a neat little app set up that I styled using Google's Materialize (anything to avoid Bootstrap!) and also tried out haml instead of erb for templating.

### R3D10
I've been going loopy with Google Scripts and have now had to fathom a way to export a single sheet to PDF without the need to hide the other sheets. That has led me to the Google Sheets API and a rather neat way to convert a Blob to a PDF. I've set up a new Gist for all things [Google Sheet to PDF Export...](https://gist.github.com/Whatapalaver/4db56950daf84cf1dd2c4765a540e17f) 
Also having fun with Ruby.pow(2) - I feel like a superhero.

### R3D8
I'm back to Conway's Game of Life and loving it. It is tying in nicely with my concurrent studying of Sandi Metz's 99 Bottles of Beer as I have somehow managed to create code with ABC size errors. That's Assignment, Branch, Condition size and means I am forcing my method to do too much. I probably need to read a bit more or risk another question on Stack Overflow.

### R3D6
Spent the day working on a google scripts project. I needed to loop through a product list and create a pdf file showing details for each one. I’ve done something similar in excel before but translating to the javascript google apps language was something new. I’m pretty impressed by the potential within google sheets, I may be about to turn my back on excel. 

### R3D5
Had my first developer interview which turned out to be an analyst role without any development. Shame, as it was a great product and I need to believe in my product. 

Progressing well with Java and I have an interesting natural disaster project brewing with the Makers cohort. 

### R3D4
Scouring NASA APIs today for potential project ideas. Also started the 99 Bottles of Beer refactoring project with Sandi Metz. 

### R3D3
I’m still waiting for feedback from my early Java exercism challenges so I have now added the Kotlin track into the mix. 

### R3D1
So it's Saturday, day after graduation day and I actually have free time and a chance to remind myself what it means to have a family. We went for a walk in the sun and pondered futures.

I'm looking for work now, but I'm keen to make sure that first job sets me off in the direction of an exciting and challenging coding future. I've been scouring LinkedIn for potentially interesting roles and everything that excited me required Java skills. So that's decided. My post Makers month of consolidation requires me to bolster my understanding of javascript and to become pretty adept at Java. It's going to be a fun ride towards challenging employment.

So on Day 1, I've installed IntelliJ Idea and completed "Hello,World!" of the exercism.io Java track. Let's see where this new journey takes me.
