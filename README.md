Whatapalaver's 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 6
===

Round 6 of 100 Days of Code will document my 10 week (and beyond) Journey to become an Algorithmic Whizz. This year I intend to get to the end of Advent of Code without it sucking every waking hour.

- [Round 5](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r5-log.md) this was supposed to cover my foray into BDD practice but I abandoned logging after 3 days so we will never know how that progressed.
- [Round 4](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r4-log.md) this covered the first 9 months or so of my first fullstack developer role
- [Round 3](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r3-log.md) documented the 70 days post Makers graduation where I consolidated the bootcamp experience, completed a stack of technical tests and finally secured myself a couple of job offers before accepting a fullstack role at The V&A.
- [Round 2](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r2-log.md) covered the 99 days of my Makers bootcamp experience. From the pre-course to graduation day.
- [Round 1](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/100_Days_of_Code/blob/master/r2-log.md) This was my initial foray into 100 Days of Code.

Gayle Laakman McDowell (with HackerRank) presents some great videos which have been collated into a [CtCI playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX6IKgS15Ue02WDPRCmYKuZicQHit9kFt) and the [session on Big O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw) was brilliantly described. I suspect I will need to do some basic math reminders on logs etc.

I've spent some time reading around my challenge. If I want to achieve a decent level of algorithmic aptitude, I need a bit of a road map for the journey. So I've read the opening chapters of Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI) and read other peoples blogs on how they achieved mastery on Leetcode.

I've signed up for a Coursera course on [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) as it was a regular feature in the blogs I read. I've watched the forst weeks videos but I can't do the practical assignments as they don't seem to be available when you only audit the class. I'm not sure if I want to invest in a Coursera subscription at this stage.

Read a bit about Big O. Have to say that the explanation in CtCI lost me quite early on so I will need to recap tomorrow.

Did my first LeetCode challenge Two Sums but can now see that I've solved it in the most naive of methods with O(n2) despite thinking I'd snuck in a few optimisations.
