# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Angela Wolff]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [February 4th, Sunday, 2018].
I've just quit my job and start the Makers Academy bootcamp in June, so #100daysofcode will set me up nicely

## Log

### R1D13
More CSS Grid tutorial but I struggled to stay engaged today. Seemed a bit too hard to follow along and scrimba doesn't seem to be quite as interactive as it promises.

### R1D12
Learning CSS Grid with a free tutorial on scrimba https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE
The grid-template-area methodology is inspired.

### R1D11
SQL progress today. Iâ€™m still working on the annual plans for Barts. Today I fathomed out how to convert a single line annual value to 12 monthly rows based on POD level profile. It was actually extremely easy - just a left join to a monthly profile table, but it gave me a great deal of satisfaction. 

### R1D10
More CWD. Uploaded my startup page to githiub and published.
Added mailchimp signup form.
I seem to have a layout problem that I need to fix now.

### R1D9
CWD Udemy course. Created a startup page with mailchimp signup form. dabbled with animate.css

### R1D8
CWD Udemy course. CSS transforms, flexbox and bootstrap. I'm so happy with the development in CSS since the early days. Bootstrap is going to be such a great help.

### R1D7
Playing around with CSS as part of the Udemy Complete Web Developer course.

### R1D6 
Chapter 4 of TWGR. Classes and modules and trialling some error capture with method_missing methods, which illustrate the use of super to pick up the kernel method_missing (or next highest definition).
Class names tend to nouns eg Stack
Module names tend to be adjectives eg. Stacklike
A class can have only 1 superclass (and therefore inherit from only one class) but it can mix in as many modules as required

### R1D5
Finished Chapter 3 of TWGR grasped the the attribute_reader / writer / accessor methods. Pretty neat.

### R1D4
Almost finished chapter 3 of TWGR. Covered inheritance and then some really conceptually tricky stuff about objects that are classes and classes that are objects. Did my head in really.
Also worked through some CSS and HTML5 work on the Udemy course. That actually looks pretty exciting, I'm impressed how much progress has been made.

### R1D3
Still working through Chapter 2 of TWGR.
Discovered the __send__ method as a way of passing a message (perhaps via user input) to an object
eg.
  if ticket_obj.respond_to?(request)
    puts icket_obj.__send__(request)
  else
    puts "No such info available"
  end

### R1D2
Today I am on to Chapter 2 of "The Well-Grounded Rubyist"
Not really a lot of coding going on as we seem to be getting to grips with the semantics of objects or maybe thats Objects.### 

### R1D1 
Continued working through the Udemy "The Complete Web Developer" course
https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/learn/v4/overview
Mostly html so far. Recapping forms. Quite interesting to see how html has progressed since I used to code websites in Dreamweaver many moons ago.
This is the Medium Article that set me off on the Udemy route:
